DP demonstration programs.
<p>
Dynamic programming is used in bioinformatics to find good ways of labeling
sequences of amino-acids or nucleotides, given that you have some model of how
things can change over time. The org.biojava.bio.dp package provides a toolkit for
building arbitrary HMMs that define grammers over
<span class="type">ResidueList</span>s. This gives you great flexibility to design
your HMM on a whim, and see if it works. The down-side of this is that we can't
guarantee that the performance of all algorithms will rival that of hand-edited
C-code.
<p>
The demonstration applications here are to show you the sorts of things that can
be done with very little effort. They are not meant as fully fledged applications,
although you may choose to build an application from them.

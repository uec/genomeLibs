Graphical interfaces for biojava objects.
<P>
Where ever possible we have used java bean like interfaces. The model view
paradigm is used, and in most cases the org.biojava.bio.seq and
org.biojava.bio.alignment interfaces form the basis of the model. Often the
actual rendering of the component is abstracted off so that the same class can
render data in different ways by swapping in an appropriate renderer. This
maintains a consistent API even when the user sees very different images.

Sequences and SequenceDBs which are composed from data taken
from a number of data sources.

<p>
This package attempts to generalize the data aggregation
facilities offered by DAS clients (e.g. the org.biojava.bio.program.das
package), and generalize them, allowing data from non-DAS sources
to be integrated.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> all APIs in this package are currently
at an experimental stage, and may change from day to day!

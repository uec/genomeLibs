Code for projecting Feature objects and systematically altering their
properties.

<p>
Feature Projection is the BioJava system whereby a feature hierarchy can be
transformed into a similar hierarchy with feature properties systematically
modified. For example, projection may translate all features by 120 residues,
or add an annotation property to all features.</p>

<p>
This package contains the underlying `engine' code for feature
projection. <code>ProjectedFeatureHolder</code> uses a
<code>ProjectionContext</code> to project a set of features.
<code>ProjectionEngine</code> does the actual magic of gluing the projected
features through a <code>ProjectionContext</code> to the underlying features.
</p>

<p>
There are several implementations of ProjectionContext provided here for your
convenience. They do standard things like translate or flip features, and
graft them into another feature hierarchy.
</P>

<p>
To develop your own projections, implement <code>ProjectionContext</code> and
provide the necessary projection methods. <code>ReparentContext</code> is a really
good base-class to use for deriving your custom projections (belive me, getting
the basics of an implementation right are not simple) and will handle both the
re-rooting of the feature hierarchy and also any event wiring needed.
</p>

<p>
<code>ProjectionContext</code> does deep voodoo involving introspeciton and class
generation. If you don't <i>really</i> want to know the gory details, we
strongly suggest that you don't take a peek inside.

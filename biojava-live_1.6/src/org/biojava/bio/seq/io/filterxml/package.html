Tools for reading and writing an XML representation of BioJava's FeatureFilter language.

<p>
These classes allow reading and writing of FeatureFilters in a human-readable XML form.
This is primarily intended for implementing web services which allow remote access to
BioJava data, but could be used as an easier way to represent complex FeatureFilters
than writing out constructors explicitly.

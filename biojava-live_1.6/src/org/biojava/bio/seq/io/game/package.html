Event-driven parsing system for the Gene Annotation Markup Elements (GAME).  It
uses the StAX API developed by Thomase Down and is extensively derived
from code he and others wrote for the XFF parser. This is currently targetted 
at the GAME 1.001 proposal.  For more information, see 
<a href="http://www.bioxml.org/Projects/game/game0.1.html">The
GAME specification page</a>.

<p>
Be aware that a newer GAME proposal has since been released.  This
release is targetted at the Gadfly Drosophila annotations which are GAME 
1.001 documents.  I make no claims that they will work for other input files
although they can be readily extended to cover other GAME structures.

<p>
There are two base classes in this release.  The first is the StAXFeatureHandler
which is the base class for elements that intend to create new Feature 
objects.  Then there is the StAXPropertyHandler class that is base class 
for element handlers that only extend properties of the existing feature. All
classes should be subclassed from one of these.

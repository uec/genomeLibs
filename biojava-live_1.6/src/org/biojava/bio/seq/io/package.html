Classes and interfaces for processing and producing flat-file representations
of sequences.
<P>
These interfaces define how to read and write arbitrary file formats. The file
format is decoupled from the type of sequence that will be produced or written.
For example, you could read in entries from a Fasta database and generate ACeDB
sequences within an ACeDB database for each entry just by configuring a
StreamReader with a FastaFormat and an AceSequenceFactory.

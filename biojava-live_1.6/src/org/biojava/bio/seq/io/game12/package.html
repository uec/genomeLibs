<p>
Event-driven parsing system for the Gene Annotation Markup Elements (GAME).  It
uses the StAX API developed by Thomase Down and is extensively derived
from code he and others wrote for the XFF parser. This is an update that is targetted 
at the GAME 1.2 proposal.  It was written specifically to parse annotation files from
the Gadfly Drosophila Genome Annotation Project although it can probably be
readily extended to other GAME files.

<p>
You should be aware that this parser doesn't set locations in the templates for
<annotation> and <feature_set> elements.  These are inferred from the exons
represented in <feature_span> elements and the data is not readily available to
the parent element during the parser run.  In my only implementation, I have a
pass in the makeSequence method of the SeqIOListener class that goes thru' to 
resolve these details.

<p>
There are two base classes in this release.  The first is the StAXFeatureHandler
which is the base class for elements that intend to create new Feature 
objects.  Then there is the StAXPropertyHandler class that is base class 
for element handlers that only extend properties of the existing feature. All
classes should be subclassed from one of these.

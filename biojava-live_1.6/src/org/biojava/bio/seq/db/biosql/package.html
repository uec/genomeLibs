General purpose Sequence storage in a relational database.
<h3>This package is Deprecated!!</h3>
<p>This package has been deprecated by the package org.biojavax.bio.db.biosql
which uses hibernate to persist objects to biosql and maintain transaction
control. We strongly recommend you use that package.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
BioSQL is a general-purpose relational database schema for the
storage of biological sequence data and annotation.  It evolved
from the bioperl-db system.
</p>

<h3>Using BioSQL</h3>

<p>
To use BioSQL, you will need:

<ul>
<li>A DBMS server (currently, PostgreSQL and MySQL are supported)</li>
<li>A JDBC driver for connecting to that database (if in doubt, contact
your database vendor)</li>
<li>A BioSQL schema file, suitable for your database.  Currently,
these can be downloaded <a href="http://www.biojava.org/download/biosql">here</a></li>
</ul>

You will need to create a new database and all the tables
specified in the schema file.  For example (for PostgreSQL users):

<pre>
    createdb thomasd_biosql
    psql thomasd_biosql -f biosqldb-schema-pg.sql
</pre>

When accessing the database from Java programs, you will need to:

<ul>
<li>Add the JDBC driver .jar file to your CLASSPATH</li>
<li>Set the <code>jdbc.drivers</code> system property to the class name of
the driver (if in doubt, contact your database vendor).</li>
</ul>

For example:

<pre>
    export CLASSPATH=biojava.jar:xerces.jar:bytecode.jar:pgjdbc2.jar
    java -Djdbc.drivers=org.postgresql.Driver demos.MyProgram
</pre>

You should now be able to connect to the database by simply
constructing a new <code>BioSQLSequenceDB</code> object, passing
your database connection details to the constructor.
</p>

<p>
Each physical BioSQL database may contain multiple namespaces (sometimes
called biodatabases).  In BioJava, each <code>SequenceDB</code> only
reflects a single namespace.
</p>

<h3>Working with BioSQL sequences</h3>

<p>
The BioJava-BioSQL objects are <em>transparently persistent</em>.  This
means that you don't need to do anything special to write data back to
the database, and that any changes you make to BioSQL sequences will
be immediately reflected in the database.  If you don't want this to happen,
consider using a <code>ViewSequence</code>.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to completely remove sequences (and all their annotation)
from the database.  However, an exception will be thrown if any references
still exist to that sequence.  The following code will fail:

<pre>
    SequenceDB seqDB = new BioSQLSequenceDB(...);
    Sequence seq = seqDB.getSequence("AL121903");
    // do things with sequence
    seqDB.removeSequence("AL121903");
</pre>

If, however, the variable <code>seq</code> is set to <code>null</code>
before calling <code>removeSequence</code>, the call will succeed.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>
In general, the behaviour of BioSQL sequences and features is
very similar to that of the standard in-memory interfaces.  However,
the current version has a few limitations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Only <code>Feature</code> and <code>StrandedFeature</code>
are currently supported.  Other sub-interfaces of <code>Feature</code>
are silently converted to one of these basic types.</li>

<li>Objects and binary data stored in <code>Annotation</code>
bundles of sequences and feature may be lost -- only Strings
and Collections of strings are safe (this may be fixed in the
future)</li>

<li>Currently, only the MySQL amd PostgreSQL databases are
supported.  Porting to other databases should, however, be
quite easy.</li>

</ul>

Classes and interfaces for defining biological sequences and informatics
objects.
<P>
This package contains the core classes and interfaces for defining
sequences and features, sequence database and iterators, and miscellaneous
biological information. All definitions are interfaces. Where ever
possible, at least one pure java implementation of the interface is
supplied.
<P>
The Sequence interface inherits the SymbolList interface, making it a list of
Symbol objects. It also implements Annotatable which allows annotation to be
attached to the entire sequence. Lastly, it implements FeatureHolder so that it
can contain features. A Sequence instance represents a concrete piece of
biological data, rather than a comp-sci abstraction.
<P>
Features are regions of a sequence which have location-specific
annotation or meaning. The location of a feature is a Location object. Features
can contain sub-features, as they are FeatureHolder implementors. They are
also annotatable. Lastly, they contain a couple of fields aimed at enhancing GFF
interoperability.
<P>
Also within this package are the classes that implement these
interfaces. They are usually preceeded with 'Simple' to indicate
that they are vanilla, pure-java implementations. You should
be able to use these objects out-of-the-box.
<P>
The DNATools and ProteinTools classes provide a central point-of-access to the
DNA and Protein alphabets and add on many operators specific to these domains.
For example, DNATools has a method 'complement' that will complement a DNA
SymbolList.

Representation of the Symbols that make up a sequence, and locations within
them.
<P>
This package
is not intended to have strong biological ties. It is here to make programming
things like dynamic-programming much easier. It also handles serialization of
well-known alphabets so that applicable singleton properties of alphabets and
Symbols are maintained.
<P>
All coordinates are in 'bio-coordinates' - that is - legal indexes start from 1
and a range is inclusive (4 to 7 includes 4, 5, 6 and 7).
<P>
A Symbol is a single token. The Symbol maintains a name, a token (char), and an
Annotation bundle. A set of Symbols is represented by an Alphabet instance. If
the Alphabet can guarantee that there are only ever a finite number of Symbols
contained with in it, then it must implement FiniteAlphabet. The Symbol objects
within a FiniteAlphabet can be tested for equality by comparing their
references directly. A SymbolList is a string over the Symbols from a single
Alphabet instance. This allows you to represent a sequence of tokens, such as
DNA nucleotides, or stock-market prices.
<P>
CrossProductAlphabet and CrossProductSymbol allow alphabets and symbols to be
represented that are the combination of two or more alphabets and symbols under
cross-product. For example, the CrossProduct alphabet DNA x DNA would contain
all di-nucleotides. DNA x DNA x DNA x Protein would contain all combinations of
three nucleotides and a single amino-acid. Dice x Coin would contain every
possible combination of dice roles (1..6) and of coin flips (Heads, Tails) as
the Symbol objects (1, Heads), (1, Tails), (2, Heads) ... (6, Tails). If any one
of the Alphabets that make up the source of a CrossProductAlphabet is not
finite, then the resulting CrossProductAlphabet will not be finite either.
<P>
Locations within a SymbolList can be represented by a Location object. This
interface defines a sub-set of points that are within the Location. This uses
bio-coordinates, and defines all the operations that you are likely to need to
build your own Locations (union, intersection and the like).

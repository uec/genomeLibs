SSAHA sequence searching API.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
SSAHA is <u>S</u>equence <u>S</u>earching <u>A</u>lgorithm by
<u>Ha</u>shing. The idea is to take a sequence database, such as EMBL,
walk over all of the sequences using a window size and step size, represent
each of these same-sized fragments as a bit-string, and use the bit-string
as an index into a hash-table. The hash-table is used to store the location
of every window (sequence and position). Search sequences are encoded as
bit-patterns in the same manner, and then this is used as an index into the
table to fetch all hits. Finaly, these hits are sorted and potentialy
merged to produce HSPs.

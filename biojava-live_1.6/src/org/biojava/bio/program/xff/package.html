Event-driven parsing system for the Extensible Feature Format (XFF).
This is currently targetted at the XFF 0.2 proposal.  For more
information, see <a href="http://www.biojava.org/thomasd/XFF/">The
XFF proposal page</a>.

<p>
XFF is an experimental format, and both the format and the APIs
in this package may change in the future.
</p>

<p>
The main class in this package is <code>XFFFeatureSetHandler</code>,
which is intended as a content handler for XFF <code>featureSet</code>
elements.  By default, this class handles the XFF <code>feature</code>
and <code>strandedFeature</code> types.  Any other feature types
are treated as one of these.  It is, however, possible to plug in
additional handlers to cope with sub-types of <code>feature</code>.
The only detail type recognized is <code>xff:prop</code> -- all others
are silently ignored.  But again, it is easy to plug in extra StAX
handlers for other detail types.
</p>

<p>
When writing a handler, for a new feature type, you will normally want
to sub-class the existing <code>FeatureHandler</code> or
<code>StrandedFeatureHanlder</code> classes.

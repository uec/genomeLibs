<p> Process files as streams of records, each with tags with values. </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> Many files in biology are structured as multiple records, each of which can
be broken down into lines composed from some tag and an associated value. For
example, EMBL files have two letter tags and values extend from column 5 to the
end of the line. There are a vast array of files all of which have broadly
similar structures, and this package aims to provide a framework within which
parsing strategies and data consumers can be reused as much as possible. </p>

<p> The data associated with each record is represented by a stream of events
encapsulated by callbacks on the <code>TagValueListener</code> interface. It is up to the
user to provide implementations of this interface that build static
representations of the data if they so wish. </p>

<h2>The <code>Parser</code> and Pushing Sub-Documents</h2>

<p> Often file formats have embedded sub-documents. For example, in EMBL format
files the feature table area is identical to that in GENBANK files if the first
five columns are ignored. In ACeDB files, every time an ace-tag is found, it
causes a new sub-document to be induced with its own structure and set of
allowed tags and values. Python code uses indent depth to represent code blocks.
</p>

<p> <code>Parser</code> allows <code>TagValueListener</code> objects to request
that all of the values associated with the current tag should be handled by a
new <code>TagValueParser</code> and <code>TagValueListener</code> pair. The
<code>Parser</code> instance will use the original <code>TagValueParser</code>
to process the line as before, and then take the value that would have been
handed to the listener's value method, and present it to the newly registered
<code>TagValueParser</code> to tokenize into tag and value portions. That tag
and value will then be passed onto the new <code>TagValueListener</code>. The
new <code>TagValueListener</code> can itself choose to push a new pair of parser
and listener to start a new sub-sub-document. This can be repeated to arbitrary
depth. As soon as a parser and listener pair are registered, the pushed listener
receives a startRecord() message. Once the entire containing record ends (due to
a record separator line such as "//", or because the end of file has been
reached), or if the tag that caused the delegation ends, the pushed listener
will receive the appropriate endTag() message and also endRecord(). </p>

<p><code>TagDelegator</code> is a useful helper class that always delegates to
a given parser and listener pair on a given tag. </p>

<h2>Rewriting the Event Stream</h2>

<p> Often while parsing, you will need to change tag names or modify values. In
the simple case, all the tags and values will be String instances. You will
probably want different types, such as the numeric objects (Double, Int and
their friends), or to instantiate your own objects from these Strings.
Additionaly, some values are themselves better represented as lists of more
fundamental items. There are several TagValueListener helper classes that extend
TagValueWrapper that allow you to configure a chain of event transducors while
writing the minimal amount of code. </p>

<p><code>TagMapper</code> remaps a sub-set of the tags it sees. For example, it
could be configured to replace all "FOO_ID" tags with "accession.number". </p>

<p><code>ValueChanger</code> intercepts the value() calls for specific tags and
uses either a <code>ValueChanger.Changer</code> or
<code>ValueChanger.Splitter</code> instance to replace or sub-devide the value
before passing it onto another listener. </p>

GFF manipulation.
<P>
GFF is a text-file format for specifying features within sequences.
For up-to-date information, go to the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF/">GFF home page</a>.
Using this package, you can load GFF from a stream, create
<span class="type">Feature</span>s on <span class="type">Sequence</span>s,
generate GFF from <span class="type">Feature</span>s and write GFF to file.
<P>
Nearly all of the API uses the concept of a GFF stream that 'pushes' GFF from
some source to a recipient. Recipients implement the
<span class="type">GFFDocumentHandler</span> interface.
<P>
There should be some demonstration programs in the
<code>biojava-live/demos/gff</code>
directory.

A flat-file ascii index of ascii flat files as per the OBDA specification.

<p>The OBDA flat file indexing specification adresses the need to provide a
cross-platform indexing scheim for flat files that are reccord based. Typically
these files have a primary ID per entry and potentially multiple secondary IDs
in potentially multiple namespaces. Different entries will all have different
primary IDs, but may shair seccondary IDs in a given namespace.</p>

<p>This package provides an API for managing these ID associations and
retrieving blocks of files accordingly. Where ever possible, a sensible choice
is made between linear scans and binary searches over ID. All index files use
fixed-length reccords to make the binary searches as fast as is feasable.</p>

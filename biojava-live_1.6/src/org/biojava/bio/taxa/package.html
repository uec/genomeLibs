Taxonomy object for representing species information.

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Many file formats such as embl and genbank include information about species
and their classifications. The objects in this package are designed to represent
that information regardless of where the data is actualy stoored. It follows
a model where the TaxonFactory is responsible for creating and managing Taxon
instances, and Taxon instances are potentialy ultra-light-weight objects.
</p>
<p>The package is <b>deprecated</b>. It is replaced by org.biojavax.bio.taxa.
This package has better persistence to biosql.</p>

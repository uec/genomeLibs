The data structures and interfaces included in this package define an
interoperable framework for simple controlled vocabularies.
<p>

When describing and representing domain-specific systems, there is
frequently a need for a string type that can only assume a limited set
of allowed values, a set, however, that is allowed to change over time
(as values are added or removed) or space (different servers accepting
different sets of strings). This need is addressed by this package.
<p>

A reference implementation of the controlled vocabularies was
developed at European Bioinformatics Institute as an open source
project <a href="http://industry.ebi.ac.uk/candy" target="_top">candy</a>.
<p>

The controlled vocabulary package consists of
<ul>
  <li> an interface <em>CandyFinder</em> whose main task is to provide
       all available vocabularies,
  <li> an interface <em>CandyVocabulary</em> who represents one
       controlled vocabulary, and
  <li> a class <em>CandyEntry</em> representing one entry/value in a
       controlled vocabulary.
</ul>

This package is used to perform regular expression searches of
SymbolLists defined in arbitrary Alphabets.
<p>
The implementation uses the java.util.regex package to perform
the heavy lifting.  Previous work had already defined a
SymbolListCharSequence class to wrap SymbolLists and permit
java.util.regex to be applied to the resultant CharSequence.
This package extends this in two ways.
<p>
First, this package implements a SymbolTokenization for
Alphabets that do not have one defined.  This is done
by arbitrarily mapping AtomicSymbols in the Alphabet
to Unicode characters in the private range.  The String
that is required defining the regex can be assembled
by calling PatternFactory.charValue() to return the
unicode character value for Symbols in the Alphabet.
<p>
Next, the structure of the package has been changed
to resemble more closely the classes in java.util.regex
albeit adapted to SymbolLists.  The APIs are very similar indeed.
<p>
<h3><u>Caveats</u></h3>
It should be noted that ambiguity symbols in the pattern String
will be expanded to specify each of the component Symbols
as a variant Symbol for matching.
<p>
Also, ambiguity and gap symbols in the target SymbolList will
be converted to the all-ambiguity symbol by the default tokenizers
and so they can be expected to <b>fail</b> to match any
specific symbol in the Pattern.  This is most frequently
the desired behaviour as blocks of N in DNA, for example,
should not be matched against any possible pattern.
